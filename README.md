# ScatterHunt
### Project Overview:
ScatterHunt is a mobile-enabled scavenger hunt Android app that allows users the opportunity to plot their own route strategies to find all the goal locations they are given. The app uses geo-tagged locations as goals when a game starts and provides those goals as a list to a user for them to accomplish.

Each list item displays a set of clues and the distance they are from the user (but not the direction). This means users need to have a concept of where they are going to accomplish each geo-goal before they start running off and creates a new dimension of optimization not found in other scavenger hunt games.

To accomplish a goal, the user must answer a question that is unique to an object at the goal they are headed to and input the answer in the list item. When all the goals have been visited and answers provided, Users are then redirected to a results view that displays stats on how they did while on the hunt!
